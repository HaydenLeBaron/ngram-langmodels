# Lang Models

This project takes training text to create
- unigram (no smoothing)
- bigram (no smoothing)
- bigram (add-one smoothing)

language models for the purpose of estimating the probability of a string under the language model.

(a)  what programming language and version you used (e.g., python3).

python3

(b)  instructions on how to compile and run your code

```
$ python3 langmodels.py <training.txt> -test <test.txt>
```

OR

```
$ bash langmodels.sh # to print the outputs of tests 1 and 2 to langmodels-output.txt
```

(c)  which CADE machine you tested your program on(this info may be useful to us if we have trouble running your program)

lab1-1

(d)  any known bugs, problems, or limitations of your program

NO KNOWN BUGS
